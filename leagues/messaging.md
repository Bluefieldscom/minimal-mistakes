<h1>Messaging for you and your players</h1>

Leagues run much better when teams are organised.


## One place for team chat. Everybody there.
Team's on Mitoo get their own group chat. Great for organising themselves, sharing photos and much more eTffective than email.

When you integrate with Mitoo we'll put all of the players in the team into one group chat automatically.

What's great about our group chat, is everyone receives messages and is kept in the loop (even if they don't have the app) because anjy players added to the team will be place in the group chat automatically.


## Two teams co-ordinating
Teams turning up to the game in the same color kit? One team forfeiting without notifying the other team?

These are problems which every league has faced. And it doesn't make players happy. 

With our captains messaging group two captains can talk to each other. Putting two captains in direct communication with each other solves these problems.

We also put the league staff in these conversations too, so you are aware of any problems and can easily guide a decision and act in other ways.


## Send league-wide alerts instantly
Sometimes you need to get a message out to a whole league or multiple leagues instantly. With our League Alerts, you can send messages and be sure that players receives them swiftly. We send the message via text, email and sms. As well as putting alerts within the app.
