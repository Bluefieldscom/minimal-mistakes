<h2>Your leagues on auto-pilot</h2>

Keep players in the loop without lifting a finger.

Mitoo keeps track of changes made to your league schedules and keeps players up-to-date. Our mobile apps are always up-to-date with the latest game information and players receive notifications around games right to their phone. Great for when a game gets postponed at the last minute.


## Send game updates automatically
Players love being kept up-to-date. With Mitoo, we'll track changes that you make in your league tool and send updates to them. Players can choose how they want to receive updates and you don't need to worry about sending hundreds of emails. We only notify who ever it affects.


## Schedule, Results and Standings
Players always have access to the latest schedule, results and standings wherever they are through our app.


## Players always in control
Players can always turn off the notifications they do not want to receive.
